# Monorepo for THEGA

This is a monorepo with multiple SvelteKit apps (storefront and component docs) sharing a UI Library.

* The `apps` directory contains applications and services (e.g. the storefront and doc sites)
* The `packages` directory is for everything else (like shared components, libraries and tooling).

Refer to these example monorepos:
