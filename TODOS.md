# TODOS

* Test Lighthouse score.
    * Implement lazy loading for images, which is how you can avoid loading all the images on a page at once. Lazy loading means waiting to download an image until it is in or near the viewport. So, for example, an image way far down the page won't load if the user never scrolls there.
    * Search for "how to implement lazy loading images in sveltekit"
* See if there is a way to automate the process of "Submitting a problem report" to Printful. Does Printful have an API for that? (I don't think they do.) Can I create an email rule in Freshdesk that will forward anything with the subject line "Problem Report" to Printful?
